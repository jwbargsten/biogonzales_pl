sub my_description {
    return <<END;
This glyph draws genomic features as rectangles. If the feature
contains subfeatures, then the glyph will draw a single solid box that
spans all the subfeatures.  Features can be named with a label at the
top, and annotated with a descriptive string at the bottom.
