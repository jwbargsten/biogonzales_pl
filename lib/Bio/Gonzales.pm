=head1 NAME

Bio::Gonzales - Speedy functions to manipulate biological data

=cut

# VERSION


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Biological data analysis is often cumbersome: most tasks are very similar, but
still there is a small difference between them. Bio::Gonzales gives you the
modules and functions that make data crunching easy and speedy, while keeping the
flexibility.

It should not be complete, the focus relies on a few standard formats. If one
is burning in format hell, L<Bio::Perl> might be a much better complement.

To outline the simple usage, here an example to read a fasta sequence file
into a array of L<Bio::Gonzales::Seq> objects.


  use Bio::Gonzales::Seq::IO qw/faslurp/;

  my @seqs = faslurp('sequences.fa');

  # Oh, f**k, somebody sent me gzipped fasta files!
  # Calm down! Gonzales has a speedy answer for that:

  my @seqs = faslurp('sequences.fa.gz');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Introdution

Motivation for this package is the lack of speed or ease of use or both in other modules.
The main branches are grouped into 

=over 4

=item Working with genomic features (representation, grouping, GFF3 input/output)

=item Workgni with sequences (FASTA input/output, basic sequence manipulation and cleaning)

=item Multiple sequence alignment input/output

=item File and folder templates to organise computational experiments

=item BLAST & HMMER3 parsing

=item Standard utility functions
